# INTRO

Since 2007 the european INSPIRE Directive aims at building a large spatial data infrastructure accross Europe.  

## Why Fit2Inspire

By using this code you will be able to implement any complex geospatial webservice based on the GML standard.

## Project overview

This project was designed following two principles : find a fast and simple way of implementing efficient and light webservices fully compliant to INSPIRE EU directive.
By using a model driven C++ framework, fit2Inspire brings a powerful method to develop and deploy a stand-alone OGC Web Feature Service (WFS2) server that can expose your data in a complex domain specific XML schema - so called application schema in the INSPIRE directive.
Most of the code is generateg by the gSOAP framework by parsing the XML schema .

## About the author

I started this project in 2012 with the ambition to develop a small business in this emerging realm of the data interoperability promoted by Inspire.

8 years later, the history leads me on another path. I recently decided to share my experience and the resulting code in this github repository, hoping this can help.
